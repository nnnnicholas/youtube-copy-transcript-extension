# Privacy Policy for Copy YouTube Transcript Extension

**Last updated: December 2024**

## Overview

The Copy YouTube Transcript Extension ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

**We collect NO personal information or data from users.**

The Extension:
- Does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data
- Does not track user behavior or usage patterns
- Does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies
- Does not communicate with external servers
- Does not store any information locally on your device

## How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely locally on your device:
1. When you click the extension icon on a YouTube page, it reads the publicly available transcript data from that page
2. It copies this transcript text to your clipboard
3. No data is sent anywhere or stored by the extension

## Permissions Used

The Extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access the current YouTube tab when you click the extension icon
- **scripting**: Enables the extension to run a script on the YouTube page to extract transcript text
- **clipboardWrite**: Allows the extension to copy the transcript to your clipboard

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and no data is collected or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there is no user data to secure. The Extension operates entirely within your browser and does not transmit information over the internet.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last updated" date.
